# OverThe Wire - Bandit

---

## Level 0

**bandit0**

ssh:secure shell

*ssh[username]@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220* : for logging in 					to the server

---

## Level 1


*ls*: lists all visible files in current directory

*cat readme*: prints the contents of the file to the screen

---

## Level 2	

*cat ./-*

'-' is a special character

./ signifies our current location in the system and identifies - as a file  

---

## Level 3

*cat “spaces in the filename”*

The filename has been put in quotes so that cat recognises the entire phrase as a filename and does not try to read and display a file for every word in the phrase

---

## Level 4

*cd inhere* : change directory

*ls -a:* lists all files in current directory

*cat .hidden*  

---

## Level 5

*cd inhere*

*file ./* : prints the type of all files in the current directory

The file command returns the type of file

 is a wildcard that can represent unlimited number of characters

*cat ./-file07*

-file07 is the only file with type ASCII text - human-readable and an outlier - so we can reasonably assume our password to be in that file

---

## Level 6

*cd inhere*

*ls -al*: lists all files in the current directory along with their information

The -l argument lists all contents in long form, that is, name of file, permissions and what type of file it is

*find . -type f -readable ! -executable -size 1033c* : finds the file with the given qualities

---

## Level 7

*cd /*: takes back to the root directory

*find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 | grep bandit* : finds the file with the given qualities

grep serves as a searching tool for our BASH command line

*cat /var/libs/dpkg/info/bandit7.password*

---

## Level 8

*cat data.txt | grep millionth*

---

## Level 9

*sort data.txt | uniq -u*

We have to sort the file first as the uniq command works for pulling unique files only from sorted lists

---

## Level 10

*strings data.txt | grep =*

The strings command searches through lines that contain ASCII text
This prints a couple of possibilities, but correlating with the previous passwords, we can tell our desired password.

---

## Level 11

*base64 -d data.txt*

-d is the decode argument

---

## Level 12

*cat data.txt | tr A-Za-z n-za-mN-ZA-M* 

The tr command is used to convert the text

---

## Level 13

*mkdir /tmp/Ravija123* : creates a directory

*cp data.txt /tmp/Ravija123* : makes a copy of the file in the directory

*cd /tmp/Ravija123*

*touch tempo* : creates a blank 

*xxd -r data.txt temp* : reverses the hexdump

*file tempo* 

*mv tempo tempo.gz*

*gunzip tempo.gz* : unzipping the tempo.gz compressed file

*file tempo*

*mv tempo tempo.bz*

*bunzip2 tempo.bz*

*mv tempo tempo.gz*

*gunzip tempo.gz*

*mv tempo tempo.tar*

*tar -f tempo.tar -x*

*file data5.bin*

*mv data5.bin data5.tar*

*tar -f data5.tar -x*

*file data6.bin*

*mv data6.bin data6.bz*

*bunzip2 data6.bz*

*file data6*

*mv data6 data6.tar*

*tar -f data6.tar -x*

*file data8.bin*

*mv data8.bin data8.gz*

*gunzip data8.gz*

*file data8*

*cat data8*

---

## Level 14

*ls -al*

*ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private*

*cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14*

---

## Level 15

*telnet localhost 30000*
