# **WEBSITE INSPECTION**

## Tools that can be used:

-View Source  
-Inspector  
-Debugger  
-Network  

1. We need discover features that could be vulnerable and can be exploited. These features are usually parts of the website that require some interactivity with the user.  
2. A good way to start is to note down the summary of individual pages/area/features.

## Page source

It is a human-readable code return from browser whenever we make a request. The code is made up of HTML ( HyperText Markup Language), CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) and JavaScript, and JavaScript provides the interactive part of the page.  

1. **Comments**- Messages left by the developer for others to see or sometimes for themselves. These are not displayed on actual webpage.
2. **Links**- Link to different html pages can be found in "<a" tag with href containing the link address.
3. **Framework**- A framework is a collection of premade code that easily allows a developer to include common features that a website would require. If we identify the framework we can find vulnerabilities in the page.

## Developer Tools
 
 These tools help developers to debug their website and get us information about what is going on under the website.
 
 1. Inspector
 2. Debugger
 3. Network

 ### INSPECTOR

 Provides us with  a live representation of what is currently on the website.We can edit them and get a live demonstration of it.  
**Paywall**-floating boxes blocking the page contents, they put a wall in front of the page so that we could see only after paying. 

### DEBUGGER

This tools helps in debugging JavaScript. It also helps developers in finding why something might not be working. In Google Chrome it is called _**Sources**_.  
 
 - **Breakpoints**- These are points in the code that we can force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution.

### NETWORK

It can be used to keep track of every external request a webpage makes.

- **AJAX**-A method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.
