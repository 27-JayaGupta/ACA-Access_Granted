## Page Source
The page source is the human-readable code returned to the client from the web server each time a request is made.It is written in html, css and javascipt.
It instructs the browser how and what content to display.  
To view the page source of a webpage, you can right-click and select "view page source" option. Viewing Page Source can give us a hint about what framework is used.

# 3 developer tools- 
## 1.Inspector.  
The page source doesn't represent what's shown on the webpage everytime, so we use element inspector to provide a live representation of what is visible on the website. Viewing page-source may not be very beneficial as we are not able to see for each element in real-time what will happen when we change its css , and sometimes we are not able to see the css for a particular element as it may be stored in an another file. We can edit and interact with the page elements using this developer tool. Any changes we make to the CSS or HTML content of the page will be reflected on the local browser. it would be temporary change untill page is reloaded.

## 2.Debugger
To dig deep into the JavaScript code of a webpage, a developer tool debugger is used. This panel in the developer tools is intended for debugging JavaScript.there is category in inspect named "Sources" in a browser. 
This feature is called Debugger in Firefox and Safari and in Google Chrome it is called Sources.  
Breakpoints can be set in the code which pause the program at that particular step until a continue command is recieved. This helps to view the state of the application after any step thereby helping to identify the flaw in the code.

## 3.Network
The network tab in developer tools is used to track all external requests made by a webpage.  
All the files requested by a page can be viewed on refreshing the page.  AJAX is a method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.
